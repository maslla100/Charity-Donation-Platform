Description:

The objective of this project is to create a collaborative MERN-stack single-page application with the following requirements:
Use React for the front end.
Use GraphQL with a Node.js and Express.js server.
Use MongoDB and the Mongoose ODM for the database.
Use queries and mutations for retrieving, adding, updating, and deleting data.
Be deployed using Render (with data).
Have a polished UI.
Be responsive.
Be interactive (i.e., accept and respond to user input).
Include authentication (JWT).
Protect sensitive API key information on the server.
Have a clean repository that meets quality coding standards (file structure, naming conventions, best practices for class and id naming conventions, indentation, high-quality comments, and so on).
Have a high-quality README (with unique name, description, technologies used, screenshot, and link to deployed application).

This application serves to create an easier way to safely donate to the charity of your choice.

Users are able to login using their email, then are free to search for a charity they wish to contribute to. This can be done via the charities displayed on the homepage, or via the search bar.

When a charity has been selected by the user, they will be prompted to learn more about the charity, or proceed to donate.

Installation:

Please install the packages within the package.json file before proceeding.
